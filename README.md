CoHMM
=====

A Co-design proxy application for the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method
(HMM).

Original authors of the source code include the students of the 2013
[Los Alamos Co-Design Summer School](http://codesign.lanl.gov/summer-school). 
CoHMM is now maintained by ExMatEx: Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials
in Extreme Environments ([exmatex.org](http://exmatex.org)).


CoHMM augmented with spatial adaptive sampling
---------------------------------------------

The code can be found on the `sad` branch.

The source was used generate the data in the paper:
