A much less naive library version of CoMD. This version takes, as input, a struct containing the information that would otherwise have been passed as command line parameters. As an output, it generates an array of structs containing pertinent data (stress tensor) for multiple time steps.
Stress tensor results casually verified, but more rigorous checking required.

Theoretically, this approach should work with any version of CoMD. However, as Dominic pointed out, we are still missing some useful information that can be generated by CoMD, so the interface will need to be changed.
Current interface is still slightly inefficient, but will require minimal changes as more parameters are needed on in and out.


This version is Thread Safe. The others weren't. Let's not talk about this too much
